# midi-instrument
## idea
This is supposed to be an application that you can use to play sine waves with your midi keyboard.
## setup
Firstly you have to install the required libraries with
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, you should be able to just plug in your midi keyboard into your computer and then run this script with.
```bash
python main.py
```
(Depending on your system, you may need to use `python3`)

You have to choose the right input and start playing. Not the nicest sound, since it's only sine waves, but I really wanted to build something like this.
